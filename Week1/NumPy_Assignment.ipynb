    "### Indexing and Slicing\n",
    "Indexing and slicing are fundamental techniques for accessing and manipulating elements of an array. Indexing is used to obtain individual elements, while slicing allows you to obtain a subset of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexing** retrieves specific elements of an array. In one-dimensional arrays, you use the index position. For multidimensional arrays, elements can be accessed using either `array[i][j]` or `array[i, j]`, where the latter is preferred. The `array[i, j]` notation is more efficient because it avoids creating a temporary intermediate array when resolving the first index, directly retrieving the desired element. This efficiency extends to higher-dimensional arrays, where elements can be accessed across multiple dimensions, e.g., `array[i, j, k]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slicing** extracts portions of an array using the syntax `array[start:end:step]`.\n",
    "- `start`: Specifies where the slice begins (inclusive)\n",
    "- `end`: Specifies where the slice ends (exclusive)\n",
    "- `step`: Determines the interval between indices\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `start` is `0`, `end` is the length of the array, and `step` is `1`. Slicing can be applied independently across dimensions in multidimensional arrays, separated by commas (e.g., `array[start:end, start:end]`). Importantly, slicing creates a view of the original array, meaning changes to the slice will reflect in the original array. If indices are out of bounds, slicing returns an empty array instead of raising an error.\n",
