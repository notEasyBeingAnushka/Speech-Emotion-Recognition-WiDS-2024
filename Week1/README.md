# Week 1
Hii guys, lets begin our endeavors with the basics of python and essential libraries.

# Resources
## VS Code Installation 
VS Code is a lightweight, powerful code editor that supports multiple programming languages and offers features like debugging, version control, and extensions, making it ideal for development across various projects. If you don't have VS code, you can install it using this [installation tutorial](https://youtu.be/bN6DE-4uFNo?si=QCo6d8CLbJAPq2JU) 

## Colab Notebooks 
You can use either VS Code or Colab notebooks for working with Jupyter notebooks, as Jupyter notebooks will be our primary tool. Colab allows you to write and execute code in separate cells, making debugging easier. It is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook service that provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs. Get started by learning the basics of Colab with this [introduction guide](https://youtu.be/iMlMfrXJYSg?feature=shared).

## Python Basics
In this course, you'll primarily be coding in Python. While you don't need an advanced understanding of the language, familiarity with basic concepts such as data types, data structures, loops, functions, and file operations is essential. To help you get started, here are some resources for learning Python fundamentals:
- [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) (in my opinion, these are the best resources. However, if you prefer video-based learning, you can also find many helpful tutorials on YouTube, such as the ones listed here.)

## NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental library for numerical computing and linear algebra in Python, providing support for arrays, matrices, and efficient mathematical operations essential for AI/ML and data science. Explore NumPy through the following resources:
- [W3Schools NumPy Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/)
- [NumPy Quickstart Tutorial](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)
- [NumPy Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/Rbh1rieb3zc?si=cgR3L9LgWgxViYDt)

## Matplotlib
Matplotlib is Python's essential plotting library, widely used for data visualization, supporting various types of plots, and serving as the foundation for other packages like pandas and Seaborn. It is a key tool for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. Get familiar with Matplotlib through these resources:
- [W3Schools Matplotlib Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp)
- [Matplotlib Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/VFsRLjSc8GA?si=6brmEkjDFHc6Bet4)

## Pandas
Pandas is a fast, powerful, and flexible Python library used for working with datasets, offering easy-to-use tools for data analysis and manipulation. It provides two main data structures: Series, which is one-dimensional and consists of a single column, and DataFrame, which is two-dimensional with rows and columns. For a basic introduction, use the following resources:
- [W3Schools Pandas Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/)
- [Pandas Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/RhEjmHeDNoA?si=ukgkIxeRFn_TZsBV)

## Librosa
Librosa is a Python library used for audio and music analysis. It provides tools for working with audio files, extracting features such as tempo, pitch, and spectral content, and performing operations like time-stretching and pitch-shifting. It's widely used in fields like music information retrieval (MIR), audio signal processing, and machine learning applications involving audio data. Here are its resources:
- [Librosa Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/MhOdbtPhbLU?si=jgJOd2vQDj8f7Rdt)
- [Librosa Documentation](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html)
