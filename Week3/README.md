## Speech-Emotion-Recognition-SoC  
## Week 3  

Hello friends! Let's start with Week 3, where we will explore Neural Networks (NN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The goal for this week is to deepen your understanding of these concepts while implementing basic models and answering key questions.

---

## TASK  

1. Implement a **basic Neural Network (NN)** model from scratch.  
2. Implement a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model using a library like TensorFlow/Keras.  
3. Answer the **short-answer questions** provided in [RNN_Question.pdf](./RNN_Question.pdf).  

**Submission Guidelines:**  
- Submit all answers and code implementations as a single PDF via:  
  - **[Google Form](https://forms.gle/UV3haB5jKd5gTWic9)**  
  - Maintain all files properly in the GitHub repository under the Week 3 folder.

## Neural Network  

The following resources explain the concepts and guide you through implementing a Neural Network. Focus on the first 7 videos in the playlist (the 8th video, which covers deep neural networks, is not relevant for this week).  

- **[Neural Network Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuhqtP7jdD8CftMk831qdE8BlIteSaNzD&si=QmF_hb_xrwac3trX)**  
  - Watch only till the 7th video.  

- **[Worked-out Example of Backpropagation](https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/)**  
  - This article provides a step-by-step walkthrough of backpropagation, a key concept in training Neural Networks.

## Recurrent Neural Network  

RNNs are powerful tools for handling sequential data. These resources explain their concepts, including LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory), and provide guidance for coding and visualization.  

- **[RNN Concepts Video](https://youtu.be/AsNTP8Kwu80?si=_LAOfQkt0frmINXM)**  
- **[LSTM Intuition Video](https://youtu.be/YCzL96nL7j0?si=X6bwunT2Ech8gWVh)**  
- **[RNN PDF](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~swaprava/courses/cs217/scribes/CS217_2024_lec13.pdf)**  
  - A detailed PDF explaining RNNs with equations and illustrations.  

- **[RNN Using Keras](https://youtu.be/3eZ56HERVbk?si=xKkj1Bb0MMwqlJN3)**  
  - A coding tutorial for implementing RNN models using Keras.
