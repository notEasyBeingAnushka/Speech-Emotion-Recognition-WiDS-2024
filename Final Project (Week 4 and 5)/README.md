# Week 4 and 5
Hey everyone! So guys, finally, our main project is on the board – let’s dive right into it! You’ll be building the whole model on your own, and don’t stress, all the instructions on how to get started and keep going are in the file.

Also, guess what? You’re free to use ChatGPT – Yayyyyyyy! But remember, it’s not for doing the whole assignment for you. Use it only when you need a bit of help or guidance – and of course, we’re always here if you need anything too.

To kick things off, you’ll need to load the data from the database. You can find it here: [Database](https://zenodo.org/records/1188976#.XsAXemgzaUk) <br>
Just a heads-up – only **download the audio files**, not the video ones. Also, check out the webpage to understand the naming convention of the files.

Let’s make this project awesome!✨
